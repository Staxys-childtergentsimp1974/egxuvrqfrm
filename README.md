OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Borderline and I don't even know where to start, honestly. You ever have one of those  s that just leaves you like... what? It’s like you’re in this whirlwind of emotions. My head’s still spinning a bit, probably should’ve gone for a coffee instead, but here we are.

I mean, first things first, if you haven’t, you NEED to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Trust me on this. It’s like binge-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 material but in one sitting, you know what I mean? So many twists... I actually didn’t know where it was going half the time. Anyway, kinda makes me think about those late-night conversations where you’re deep AF, but then it’s like, oh I need to sleep, but instead, you keep talking.

> But it’s crazy, right? The way it paints these characters, like all flawed and real, not your typical Hollywood gloss. Might be why I'm almost too tired to can anymore. Feels like I’ve run a marathon but in my brain. Sort of reminds me of why I love being a hairdresser, honestly... too many layers, literally and metaphorically!

I guess that’s the magic with  s like that. Oh, and somehow managed to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with no interruptions, which is a miracle 'cause you know how life just loves to throw surprises. It's like the ultimate sign that it was meant to be, lol.

Just when the plot hits you with the sledgehammer... and then you start reevaluating your WHOLE life. Like okay, did I make the right choices? Am I doing this adulting thing properly? To be honest, feels like it’s gonna stick in my head longer than my last client’s haircut, haha. Can't say it’s a bad thing.

It's almost like these directors... they know us better than we know ourselves, which, scary much? But it’s the good kinda scary. Like rollercoaster vibes without the actual, you know, feeling like you’re gonna hurl part.

if len(borderline) % 2 == 0; print(keep 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨)

And suddenly it’s late, and I’m rambling again—classic me. Dude, if you're up for some brain gymnastics and maybe a touch of an existential crisis, this is your next 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. Seriously, you won’t regret it. Or maybe you will, but in the best way possible. Okay, I gotta hit the sack, we’ll chat more soon.
